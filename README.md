A farmer has prepared a piece of land where he grows various plants. including trees and bushes
flowers, all trees have positive integer code. In total, two types of trees will be planted in this land
became. windy trees whose water consumption is k cubic meters multiplied by the height of that tree
Each particular tree is a constant value.
Fruit trees whose fruits are for sale, the amount of water used in them is p multiplied by the amount
The product of that tree is in kilograms.
The p coefficient is the same for all fruit trees
All trees, except for their own consumption, also consume T cubic meters. - T value for
All trees are fixed. The flower bushes planted in this agricultural land are also used to decorate the area
are used, each of which has a positive integer code
Each bush has a number of flower branches and the water consumption of all flower bushes is 4 cubic meters per flower branch
Is
In addition to the fixed amount of 10 cubic meters
The flowers of the rose bushes are of good quality that are sold
The price of each flower branch is R Toman, which is the same for all rose branches.

- R : The price of each flower
- T : static variable
- P : Water consumption coefficient for trees
